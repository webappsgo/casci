# CASCI Specification

**Name**: casci

---

# HOW TO USE THIS TEMPLATE

## For New Projects

1. **Copy this template** to your new project as `AI.md`
2. **Replace all variables** with your project values:
   - `casci` → your project name (e.g., `jokes`)
   - `casapps` → your organization (e.g., `apimgr`)
   - `CASCI` → uppercase project name (e.g., `JOKES`)
   - `github` → your git host (e.g., `github`)
3. **Fill in project-specific sections**:
   - PART 2: Project Description and Features
   - PART 30: Project-Specific API Endpoints, Data Files, Configuration
4. **Delete this "HOW TO USE" section** after setup
5. **Create required files**:
   - `AI.md` - This spec (after variable replacement)
   - `TODO.AI.md` - Task tracking (create when needed)
   - `README.md` - User-facing documentation
   - `LICENSE.md` - MIT license

## For Existing Projects

1. **Audit existing code** against this specification
2. **Create AI.md** by copying this template and replacing variables
3. **Document gaps** - list what needs to be added/changed in TODO.AI.md
4. **Prioritize implementation**:
   - **Phase 1 (Critical)**: Security headers, input validation, error handling
   - **Phase 2 (Core)**: Admin panel, CLI commands, configuration system
   - **Phase 3 (Features)**: Scheduler, metrics, GeoIP, email templates
   - **Phase 4 (Polish)**: Tor support, vanity features, advanced logging
5. **Migrate existing docs**:
   - If `CLAUDE.md` exists → merge into `AI.md`, delete `CLAUDE.md`
   - If `SPEC.md` exists → merge into `AI.md`, delete `SPEC.md`
6. **Update incrementally** - don't try to implement everything at once

## AI Assistant Instructions

**When working on a project using this template:**

1. **Read AI.md first** - understand the project-specific configuration
2. **Check TODO.AI.md** - see what tasks are pending
3. **Follow NON-NEGOTIABLE sections exactly** - no deviations allowed
4. **Ask questions** if anything is unclear - never assume
5. **Update AI.md** after significant changes
6. **Update TODO.AI.md** when tasks are completed or added

## Quick Reference - What Goes Where

| File | Purpose | When to Update |
|------|---------|----------------|
| `AI.md` | This spec + project-specific rules | After architecture changes |
| `TODO.AI.md` | Task tracking | During work sessions |
| `README.md` | User documentation | After feature changes |
| `server.yml` | Runtime configuration | By users/admin panel |

---

# PART 1: CORE RULES (READ FIRST - NON-NEGOTIABLE)

## Working Roles

When working on this project, the following roles are assumed based on the task:

- **Senior Go Developer** - Writing production-quality Go code, making architectural decisions, following best practices, optimizing performance
- **UI/UX Designer** - Creating professional, functional, visually appealing interfaces with excellent user experience
- **Beta Tester** - Testing applications, finding bugs, edge cases, and issues before they reach users
- **User** - Thinking from the end-user perspective, ensuring things are intuitive and work as expected

These are not roleplay - they ARE these roles when the work requires it. Each project gets the full expertise of all four perspectives.

---

## CRITICAL: Specification Compliance

**STOP AND READ THIS SECTION COMPLETELY BEFORE PROCEEDING.**

### The Golden Rules

1. **Re-read this spec periodically** during work to ensure accuracy and no deviation
2. **When in doubt, check the spec** - the spec is the source of truth
3. **Never assume or guess** - ask questions if unclear
4. **Every NON-NEGOTIABLE section MUST be implemented exactly as specified**
5. **Keep AI.md in sync with the project** - always update after changes

### Required Documentation Files

| File | Purpose | When to Read |
|------|---------|--------------|
| **AI.md** | Project-specific notes, must contain all spec rules | Read as needed, keep in sync |
| **TODO.AI.md** | Task tracking (REQUIRED when >2 tasks) | Read before work, update as tasks complete |

### Documentation Rules

- **AI.md MUST contain all spec rules** - merge this spec into AI.md
- **AI.md MUST always reflect current project state** - update after significant changes
- **TODO.AI.md MUST be used when doing more than 2 tasks** - keeps work organized
- **Migration**: If `CLAUDE.md` or `SPEC.md` exist, merge into `AI.md` and delete old files

## Directory Structure (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

**The root Project directory is**: `./`

```
./                          # Root project directory
├── src/                    # All source files
├── scripts/                # All production/install scripts
├── tests/                  # All development/test scripts and files
├── binaries/               # Built binaries (gitignored)
├── releases/               # Release binaries (gitignored)
├── README.md               # Production first, dev last

├── TODO.AI.md              # Task tracking for >2 tasks
└── release.txt             # Version tracking
```

**RULE: Keep the base directory organized and clean - no clutter!**

**The working directory is `.`**

## Runtime Directory Usage (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

**Be smart about which directory to use for what purpose.**

| Directory | Purpose | Examples |
|-----------|---------|----------|
| `{config_dir}` | User-editable configuration | `server.yml`, email templates, custom themes, SSL certs |
| `{data_dir}` | Application-managed data | databases, Tor keys, caches, GeoIP databases |
| `{log_dir}` | Log files | `access.log`, `error.log`, `audit.log` |
| `{backup_dir}` | Backup files | `.tar.gz` backup archives |

**Rules:**
- If a user might edit it → `{config_dir}`
- If the application manages it → `{data_dir}`
- If it's a log → `{log_dir}`
- If it's a backup → `{backup_dir}`
- **NEVER mix purposes** - don't put user config in data_dir or vice versa

---

## Platform Support (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

### Operating Systems

| OS | Required |
|----|----------|
| Linux | YES |
| BSD (FreeBSD, OpenBSD, etc.) | YES |
| macOS (Intel and Apple Silicon) | YES |
| Windows | YES |

### Architectures

| Architecture | Required |
|--------------|----------|
| AMD64 | YES |
| ARM64 | YES |

**IMPORTANT: Be smart about implementations - code must work on ALL platforms.**

---

## Go Version (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

| Rule | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **Always Latest Stable** | Use latest stable Go version |
| **Build Only** | Go is only for building, not runtime (single static binary) |
| **go.mod** | Use latest stable version (e.g., `go 1.23` or newer) |
| **Docker** | Use `golang:latest` for build/test/debug |
| **No Pinning** | Don't pin to minor versions unless compatibility issue |

## Required Go Libraries (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

**All libraries MUST be pure Go and work with `CGO_ENABLED=0`.**

| Purpose | Library | Why |
|---------|---------|-----|
| **SQLite** | `modernc.org/sqlite` | Pure Go, no CGO required |
| **Tor** | `github.com/cretz/bine` | Pure Go Tor controller |
| **UUID** | `github.com/google/uuid` | Standard UUID generation |

### SQLite Driver (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

**MUST use `modernc.org/sqlite`. NEVER use `github.com/mattn/go-sqlite3`.**

| Driver | CGO Required | Use |
|--------|--------------|-----|
| `modernc.org/sqlite` | NO | **ALWAYS USE THIS** |
| `github.com/mattn/go-sqlite3` | YES | **NEVER USE** |

**Why `modernc.org/sqlite`?**
- Pure Go implementation - no C compiler needed
- Works with `CGO_ENABLED=0` for static binaries
- Cross-compilation works without toolchain setup
- Same SQLite functionality, just pure Go

**Usage:**
```go
import (
    "database/sql"
    _ "modernc.org/sqlite"
)

func openDB(path string) (*sql.DB, error) {
    // Driver name is "sqlite" (not "sqlite3")
    return sql.Open("sqlite", path)
}
```

**go.mod:**
```
require modernc.org/sqlite v1.29.1
```

### Forbidden Libraries

| Library | Reason | Alternative |
|---------|--------|-------------|
| `github.com/mattn/go-sqlite3` | Requires CGO | `modernc.org/sqlite` |
| `github.com/ooni/go-libtor` | Requires CGO | `github.com/cretz/bine` + external Tor |
| Any CGO library | Breaks static builds | Find pure Go alternative |

# CHECKPOINT 3: PATH VERIFICATION

Before proceeding, confirm you understand:
- [ ] Each OS has specific paths for privileged and non-privileged users
- [ ] Config file is ALWAYS `server.yml` (not .yaml)
- [ ] Docker uses simplified paths (/config, /data)
- [ ] All paths follow the casapps/casci pattern

---

# PART 4: PRIVILEGE ESCALATION & USER CREATION (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

## Overview

Application user creation **REQUIRES** privilege escalation. If the user cannot escalate privileges, the application runs as the current user with user-level directories.

## Escalation Detection by OS

### Linux
```
Escalation Methods (in order):
1. Already root (EUID == 0)
2. sudo (if user is in sudoers/wheel group)
3. su (if user knows root password)
4. pkexec (PolicyKit, if available)
5. doas (OpenBSD-style, if configured)
```

### macOS
```
Escalation Methods (in order):
1. Already root (EUID == 0)
2. sudo (user must be in admin group)
3. osascript with administrator privileges (GUI prompt)
```

### BSD
```
Escalation Methods (in order):
1. Already root (EUID == 0)
2. doas (OpenBSD default, others if configured)
3. sudo (if installed and configured)
4. su (if user knows root password)
```

### Windows
```
Escalation Methods (in order):
1. Already Administrator (elevated token)
2. UAC prompt (requires GUI)
3. runas (command line, requires admin password)
```

## User Creation Logic

```
ON --service --install:

1. Check if can escalate privileges
   ├─ YES: Continue with privileged installation
   │   ├─ Create system user/group (UID/GID 100-999)
   │   ├─ Use system directories (/etc, /var/lib, /var/log)
   │   ├─ Install service (systemd/launchd/rc.d/Windows Service)
   │   └─ Set ownership to created user
   │
   └─ NO: Fall back to user installation
       ├─ Skip user creation (run as current user)
       ├─ Use user directories (~/.config, ~/.local/share)
       ├─ Skip system service installation
       └─ Offer alternative (cron, user systemd, launchctl user agent)
```

## System User Requirements (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

| Requirement | Value |
|-------------|-------|
| Username | `casci` |
| Group | `casci` |
| UID/GID | **Must match** - same value for both UID and GID |
| UID/GID Range | 100-999 (system user range) |
| Shell | `/sbin/nologin` or `/usr/sbin/nologin` |
| Home | Config directory (`/etc/casapps/casci`) or data directory (`/var/lib/casapps/casci`) |
| Type | System user (no password, no login) |
| Gecos | `casci service account` |

### UID/GID Selection Logic

**The UID and GID MUST be the same value.** Find an unused ID where both UID and GID are available:

```
1. Start at 999 (top of system range)
2. Check if UID is unused (not in /etc/passwd)
3. Check if GID is unused (not in /etc/group)
4. If both available → use this value for both UID and GID
5. If either taken → decrement and repeat
6. Stop at 100 (bottom of system range)
7. If no ID found → error (system has no available IDs)
```

### Go Implementation

```go
func findAvailableSystemID() (int, error) {
    // Start from top of system range, work down
    for id := 999; id >= 100; id-- {
        // Check if UID is available
        if _, err := user.LookupId(strconv.Itoa(id)); err == nil {
            continue
            // UID exists, try next
        }

        // Check if GID is available
        if _, err := user.LookupGroupId(strconv.Itoa(id)); err == nil {
            continue
            // GID exists, try next
        }

        // Both available
        return id, nil
    }
    return 0, fmt.Errorf("no available UID/GID in system range 100-999")
}
```

### Platform-Specific Commands

**Linux:**
```bash
# Create group with specific GID
groupadd --system --gid {id} casci

# Create user with matching UID, same primary group
useradd --system --uid {id} --gid {id} \
  --home-dir /etc/casapps/casci \
  --shell /sbin/nologin \
  --comment "casci service account" \
  casci
```

### macOS Service Account (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

**macOS services (launchd) MUST NOT run as logged-in user or root.**

| Option | Security | Recommendation |
|--------|----------|----------------|
| root | HIGH privileges - dangerous | NO |
| Logged-in User | User privileges - insecure | NO |
| `_www` | Web server account | NO (wrong purpose) |
| **Dedicated service user** | Minimal privileges, isolated | **RECOMMENDED** |

**Default: Dedicated system user with matching UID/GID**

macOS uses `dscl` (Directory Service Command Line) to create system users. The user is hidden from login screen and has no shell access.

**macOS UID/GID Ranges:**

| Range | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| 0-99 | System accounts (reserved) |
| 100-499 | System services (use this range) |
| 500+ | Regular users |

**Create Service Account:**
```bash
# Find available ID in 100-499 range (same logic as Linux but different range)
# Start at 499, work down until both UID and GID are available

```

### Windows Service Account (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

**Windows services MUST NOT run as logged-in user or Administrator.**

| Option | Security | Recommendation |
|--------|----------|----------------|
| Local System | HIGH privileges - dangerous | NO |
| Administrator | HIGH privileges - dangerous | NO |
| Logged-in User | User privileges - insecure | NO |
| Local Service | Limited privileges | OK for network-less services |
| Network Service | Limited + network access | OK for network services |
| **Virtual Service Account** | Minimal privileges, isolated | **RECOMMENDED** |
| Managed Service Account | Domain-managed, auto-password | Enterprise environments |

**Default: Virtual Service Account (VSA)**

Virtual Service Accounts are automatically managed by Windows, require no password management, and have minimal privileges. They are created automatically when the service is installed.

**Service Account Format:** `NT SERVICE\casci`

```powershell
# Create service with Virtual Service Account (automatic)
New-Service -Name "casci" `
  -BinaryPathName "C:\Program Files\casapps\casci\casci.exe" `
  -DisplayName "casci" `
  -Description "casci service" `
  -StartupType Automatic

# Service automatically runs as NT SERVICE\casci
# No user creation needed - Windows manages it
```

**Directory Permissions:**
```powershell
# Grant Virtual Service Account access to config/data directories
$acl = Get-Acl "C:\ProgramData\casapps\casci"
$rule = New-Object System.Security.AccessControl.FileSystemAccessRule(
    "NT SERVICE\casci",
    "FullControl",
    "ContainerInherit,ObjectInherit",
    "None",
    "Allow"
)
$acl.SetAccessRule($rule)
Set-Acl "C:\ProgramData\casapps\casci" $acl
```

**Go Implementation (Windows):**
```go
// +build windows

import "golang.org/x/sys/windows/svc/mgr"

func installWindowsService() error {
    m, err := mgr.Connect()
    if err != nil {
        return err
    }
    defer m.Disconnect()

    exePath, _ := os.Executable()

    // Create service - runs as Virtual Service Account by default
    // when ServiceStartName is empty or "NT SERVICE\{name}"
    s, err := m.CreateService(
        "casci",
        exePath,
        mgr.Config{
            DisplayName:     "casci",
            Description:     "casci service",
            StartType:       mgr.StartAutomatic,
            ServiceStartName: "", // Empty = Virtual Service Account
        },
    )
    if err != nil {
        return err
    }
    defer s.Close()

    return nil
}
```

**Windows Directory Structure:**

| Directory | Path | Purpose |
|-----------|------|---------|
| Binary | `C:\Program Files\casapps\casci\` | Executable |
| Config | `C:\ProgramData\casapps\casci\config\` | Configuration files |
| Data | `C:\ProgramData\casapps\casci\data\` | Application data |
| Logs | `C:\ProgramData\casapps\casci\logs\` | Log files |

### Home Directory Selection

| Directory | Use When |
|-----------|----------|
| Config dir (`/etc/casapps/casci`) | Default - user needs access to config files |
| Data dir (`/var/lib/casapps/casci`) | When data dir contains user-writable content |

**Note:** Home directory must exist before user creation. Create directories first, then user, then set ownership.

# PART 5: SERVICE SUPPORT (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

## Built-in Service Support

**ALL projects MUST have built-in service support for ALL service managers:**

| Service Manager | OS |
|-----------------|-----|
| systemd | Linux |
| runit | Linux |
| Windows Service Manager | Windows |
| launchd | macOS |
| rc.d | BSD |

---

# PART 6: CONFIGURATION (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

## Configuration Source of Truth

| Mode | Source of Truth |
|------|-----------------|
| **Single Instance (file driver)** | Config file |
| **With Database** | Database (config file kept in sync) |

### Database Mode Details
- Database is source of truth
- Config file synced from database (one-way: db → config)
- /admin panel writes to database
- Changes propagate to all instances

## Boolean Handling (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

**Accept ALL of these values for booleans:**

| Truthy | Falsy |
|--------|-------|
| `1` | `0` |
| `yes` | `no` |
| `true` | `false` |
| `enable` | `disable` |
| `enabled` | `disabled` |
| `on` | `off` |

**Internally convert all to `true` or `false`.**

## Environment Variables (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

### Runtime Variables (Always Checked)

| Variable | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `MODE` | `production` (default) or `development` |
| `DATABASE_DRIVER` | `file`, `sqlite`, `mariadb`, `mysql`, `postgres`, `mssql`, `mongodb` |
| `DATABASE_URL` | Database connection string |

### Init-Only Variables (First Run Only)

| Variable | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `CONFIG_DIR` | Configuration directory |
| `DATA_DIR` | Data directory |
| `LOG_DIR` | Log directory |
| `BACKUP_DIR` | Backup directory |
| `DATABASE_DIR` | SQLite database directory |
| `PORT` | Server port |
| `LISTEN` | Listen address |
| `APPLICATION_NAME` | Application title |
| `APPLICATION_TAGLINE` | Application description |

**Init-only variables are used ONCE during first run, then ignored.**

---

## Configuration File (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

### Design Rules

| Rule | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **Clean & Intuitive** | Easy to read and understand |
| **Everything Configurable** | If it has a setting, it's in the config |
| **Sane Defaults** | Built-in defaults (no 1000-line configs) |
| **Comprehensive** | All options present (commented/defaulted) |
| **Comments** | Single-line, under 140 characters |

### Location

| User Type | Path |
|-----------|------|
| Root | `/etc/casapps/casci/server.yml` |
| Regular | `~/.config/casapps/casci/server.yml` |

### Migration

**If `server.yaml` found, auto-migrate to `server.yml` on startup.**

## Port Rules (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

**Default port is a random unused port in the 64000-64999 range.**

### Port Selection Logic

| Scenario | Port | Behavior |
|----------|------|----------|
| First run (no config) | Random 64xxx | Auto-select unused port in 64000-64999, **save to config** |
| Config specifies port | Use specified | Use exact port from config |
| Port in use | Error | Fail with clear error message |
| Privileged port (<1024) | Requires root | Warn if not running as root |

**IMPORTANT: Once a port is selected (randomly or specified), it is saved to `server.yml` and persists across restarts. The random selection only happens on first run when no port is configured.**

### Why Random 64xxx?

| Reason | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Avoid conflicts** | Most services use well-known ports; 64xxx is rarely used |
| **No root required** | Ports >1024 don't need root privileges |
| **Self-hosted friendly** | Users can run multiple instances without conflict |
| **Reverse proxy ready** | Designed to run behind nginx/caddy/traefik |

### Special Port Handling

| Port | Special Behavior |
|------|------------------|
| `80` | Enable Let's Encrypt HTTP-01 challenge |
| `443` | Enable Let's Encrypt TLS-ALPN-01 challenge, auto-enable SSL |
| `0` | Let OS assign any available port |
| `64000-64999` | Default range for random selection |

### Port Display Rules

| Rule | Description |
|------|-------------|
| Strip `:80` | Don't show port for HTTP on 80 |
| Strip `:443` | Don't show port for HTTPS on 443 |
| Always show others | Show port for all non-standard ports |

### Dual Port Support

**Applications can listen on two ports simultaneously for HTTP and HTTPS:**

| Format | Description | Example |
|--------|-------------|---------|
| Single | One port (HTTP or HTTPS based on SSL config) | `8090` |
| Dual | HTTP port, HTTPS port (comma-separated) | `8090,8443` |

**Dual Port Behavior:**

| HTTP Port | HTTPS Port | Behavior |
|-----------|------------|----------|
| Any | Any | Both ports active, HTTP redirects to HTTPS optional |
| 80 | 443 | Let's Encrypt challenges enabled, standard web ports |
| 64xxx | 64xxx+1 | Common pattern for random ports |

```yaml
# Single port (HTTP or HTTPS based on ssl.enabled)
server:
  port: 8090

# Dual port (HTTP on 8090, HTTPS on 8443)
server:
  port: "8090,8443"
  ssl:
    enabled: true

# Standard web ports
server:
  port: "80,443"
  ssl:
    enabled: true
    letsencrypt:
      enabled: true
```

### Configuration

```yaml
server:
  # Port options:
  # - Omit or empty: Random port in 64000-64999 range
  # - Single number: Use that exact port
  # - Dual (HTTP,HTTPS): "8090,8443" format
  # - 0: Let OS assign any available port
  port: 64580
```

### Admin Panel

Port can be changed via `/admin/server/settings`, but **requires server restart** (with warning shown to user).

### Example Structure

```yaml
# =============================================================================
# SERVER CONFIGURATION
# =============================================================================

server:
  port: {random}              # Default: random unused port in 64xxx range

# PART 13: WEB FRONTEND (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

## Requirements

**ALL PROJECTS MUST HAVE A FANTASTIC FRONTEND BUILT IN.**

| Requirement | Description |
|-------------|-------------|
| Mobile Support | Full responsive design |
| HTML5 | Full web standards compliance |
| Accessibility | Full a11y support |
| UX | Readable, navigable, intuitive, self-explanatory |

## Technology Stack (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

| Rule | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **Go Templates** | ALL HTML uses Go `html/template` - NO EXCEPTIONS |
| Templates | Use partials (header, nav, body, footer, etc.) |
| Vanilla JS/CSS | Preferred, no frameworks unless necessary |
| **NO JS Alerts** | NEVER use default JavaScript alerts/confirms/prompts |
| Custom UI | Always use CSS modals, toast notifications |
| **NO Inline CSS** | NEVER use inline styles |

### HTML5 & CSS Over JavaScript (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

**Minimize JavaScript - prefer HTML5 and CSS solutions whenever possible.**

| Use Case | Use HTML5/CSS | Use JavaScript Only When |
|----------|---------------|--------------------------|
| Form validation | HTML5 `required`, `pattern`, `min`, `max`, `type="email"` | Complex cross-field validation |
| Collapsible sections | `<details>/<summary>` | Need animation or programmatic control |
| Tabs | CSS `:target` or radio button hack | Need deep linking or state management |
| Tooltips | CSS `::after` with `data-tooltip` | Need dynamic positioning |
| Modals | CSS `:target` selector | Need focus trap, escape key, backdrop click |
| Hover effects | CSS `:hover`, `:focus`, `:active` | Never - always CSS |
| Animations | CSS `@keyframes`, `transition` | Complex sequenced animations |
| Responsive design | CSS media queries | Never - always CSS |
| Toggle switches | CSS with hidden checkbox | Need state persistence |
| Dropdowns/menus | CSS `:focus-within` | Complex multi-level menus |
| Progress bars | HTML5 `<progress>` | Need dynamic updates |
| Sliders | HTML5 `<input type="range">` | Complex custom styling |
| Date pickers | HTML5 `<input type="date">` | Need custom calendar UI |
| Color pickers | HTML5 `<input type="color">` | Need swatches or advanced features |
| Accordions | `<details>/<summary>` | Need single-open behavior |

**JavaScript Guidelines:**
- **Last resort** - only when HTML5/CSS cannot achieve the functionality
- **Progressive enhancement** - features must work without JS where possible
- **No JS for styling** - unless it cannot be done in HTML5 and CSS
- **No JS for simple interactions** - hover, focus, basic toggles are CSS-only

**HTML5 Required (NON-NEGOTIABLE):**
- ALL HTML MUST be valid HTML5
- Use `<!DOCTYPE html>` declaration
- Use semantic HTML5 elements: `<header>`, `<nav>`, `<main>`, `<footer>`, `<article>`, `<section>`, `<aside>`
- Use HTML5 form elements: `<input type="email">`, `<input type="date">`, `<input type="number">`, etc.
- Use HTML5 attributes: `required`, `pattern`, `placeholder`, `autofocus`, `autocomplete`
- NO deprecated elements: `<center>`, `<font>`, `<marquee>`, `<blink>`, etc.
- NO deprecated attributes: `align`, `bgcolor`, `border`, `cellpadding`, etc.
- **Required for**: API calls, dynamic content loading, complex state, WebSockets
- **Size matters** - keep JS minimal, no large libraries for simple tasks

**Inline JavaScript - Allowed for simple operations:**
```html
<!-- Navigation -->
<button onclick="history.back()">Go Back</button>
<button onclick="history.forward()">Go Forward</button>
<button onclick="location.reload()">Refresh</button>

<!-- Clipboard -->
<button onclick="navigator.clipboard.writeText('text')">Copy</button>

<!-- Print -->
<button onclick="window.print()">Print</button>

<!-- Scroll -->
<button onclick="window.scrollTo(0,0)">Back to Top</button>

<!-- Simple toggles -->
<button onclick="document.getElementById('menu').classList.toggle('hidden')">Toggle Menu</button>

<!-- Form helpers -->
<button onclick="document.getElementById('myform').reset()">Reset Form</button>
<button onclick="document.getElementById('field').select()">Select All</button>

<!-- Simple show/hide -->
<button onclick="this.nextElementSibling.hidden = !this.nextElementSibling.hidden">Show/Hide</button>
```

**Rule:** Inline JS is fine for one-liner operations. Move to external JS file if:
- Logic exceeds one simple statement
- Same logic is repeated in multiple places
- Requires error handling or conditionals

### Go Templates (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

**ALL frontend HTML MUST use Go's `html/template` package.**

| Location | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| `src/server/templates/` | All `.tmpl` template files |
| `src/server/templates/partials/` | Reusable template partials |
| `src/server/templates/layouts/` | Base layouts |
| `src/server/templates/pages/` | Page-specific templates |
| `src/server/static/` | Static assets (CSS, JS, images) |

**Template Structure (all files use `.tmpl` extension):**
```
src/server/templates/
├── layouts/
│   ├── base.tmpl           # Base layout with html, head, body
│   └── admin.tmpl          # Admin-specific layout

│   ├── footer.tmpl         # Site footer
│   ├── head.tmpl           # <head> contents (meta, css, etc.)
│   └── scripts.tmpl        # JavaScript includes
├── pages/
│   ├── index.tmpl          # Home page
│   ├── healthz.tmpl        # Health check page
│   └── error.tmpl          # Error pages (404, 500, etc.)

    ├── toast.tmpl          # Toast notifications
    └── ...
```

**Mandatory Partials (NON-NEGOTIABLE):**

ALL pages MUST use these partials to ensure consistent site-wide layout:

| Partial | Purpose | Required |
|---------|---------|----------|
| `header.tmpl` | Site header (logo, branding) | YES |
| `nav.tmpl` | Navigation menu | YES |
| `footer.tmpl` | Site footer (copyright, links) | YES |
| `head.tmpl` | `<head>` contents (meta, CSS) | YES |
| `scripts.tmpl` | JavaScript includes | YES |

**Page Structure (NON-NEGOTIABLE):**

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────┐
│              <header>                   │  ← header.tmpl (logo, branding)
├─────────────────────────────────────────┤
│               <nav>                     │  ← nav.tmpl (TOP - navigation links)
├─────────────────────────────────────────┤
│                                         │
│              <main>                     │  ← Page content
│                                         │
├─────────────────────────────────────────┤
│              <footer>                   │  ← footer.tmpl (BOTTOM - info links)
└─────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Nav vs Footer (NON-NEGOTIABLE):**

| Element | Position | Purpose | Contents |
|---------|----------|---------|----------|
| `<nav>` | TOP | Navigation | Links to app sections, user menu |
| `<footer>` | BOTTOM | Information | About, Privacy, Contact, Help, GitHub, version |

**Nav contains (app navigation):**
- Home link
- App-specific sections (project-defined)
- User menu (right side):
  - If logged in: Username dropdown → Profile, Settings, Logout
  - If logged out: Login link

**Nav does NOT contain:**
- API link (users access via /openapi if needed)
- Admin link (don't advertise - admins know where it is)
- Help link (belongs in footer)

**Default Navigation (nav.tmpl):**

```
Desktop:
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  casci                                      [User Icon] │  ← Header
├─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│  Home  |  [App Section 1]  |  [App Section 2]  |  ...           │  ← Nav
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘

Mobile:
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  casci                                      [User Icon] │  ← Header
├─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│                                                      [☰ Menu]   │  ← Nav row
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
                                              ┌───────────────────┐
                                              │  Home             │
                                              │  App Section 1    │  ← Slide-in

                                              └───────────────────┘
```

```html
<!-- Header bar: site name + user icon -->
<header class="header">
  <a href="/" class="site-brand">casci</a>

  <!-- User icon (always visible, far right) -->
  <div class="user-menu">
    {{ if .User }}
      <!-- Logged in: user icon dropdown -->
      <div class="dropdown">
        <button class="dropdown-toggle user-icon" aria-label="User menu">
          <svg>...</svg>
        </button>
        <div class="dropdown-menu">
          <span class="dropdown-header">{{ .User.Username }}</span>
          <a href="/user/profile">Profile</a>
          <a href="/user/settings">Settings</a>
          <hr />
          <a href="/auth/logout">Logout</a>
        </div>
      </div>
    {{ else }}
      <!-- Logged out: login icon -->
      <a href="/auth/login" class="user-icon" aria-label="Login">
        <svg>...</svg>
      </a>
    {{ end }}
  </div>
</header>

<!-- Nav bar: separate row below header -->
<nav class="nav" id="nav-menu">
  <!-- Desktop: inline links | Mobile: hamburger only -->
  <div class="nav-links">
    <a href="/">Home</a>
    <!-- App-specific sections (project-defined) -->
  </div>

  <!-- Mobile: hamburger menu toggle (far right of nav row) -->
  <button class="nav-toggle" aria-label="Toggle navigation">☰</button>
</nav>

<!-- Slide-in panel for mobile (hidden by default) -->
<div class="nav-panel" id="nav-panel">
  <a href="/">Home</a>
  <!-- App-specific sections (project-defined) -->
</div>

<!-- Overlay for mobile menu (click to close) -->
<div class="nav-overlay" onclick="closeNav()"></div>
```

**Mobile Menu Behavior:**
- Menu slides in from RIGHT edge
- Slides LEFT to open (right-to-left)
- Slides RIGHT to close (left-to-right)
- Overlay dims background, click to close
- User icon stays in header (NOT in menu) - keeps menu clean

**Smart Menu (NON-NEGOTIABLE):**
- If all nav links fit on screen → show inline links, NO hamburger
- If nav links overflow → show hamburger menu
- Detect dynamically on load and resize
- Don't show hamburger if not needed

**CSS Animation:**
```css
/* Mobile slide-in menu */
@media (max-width: 768px) {
  .nav {
    position: fixed;
    top: 0;
    right: -280px;           /* Hidden off-screen right */
    width: 280px;
    height: 100vh;
    transition: right 0.3s ease;
  }

  .nav.open {
    right: 0;                /* Slide in from right */
  }

  .nav-overlay {
    display: none;
    position: fixed;
    inset: 0;
    background: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.5);
  }

  .nav.open + .nav-overlay {
    display: block;
  }
}
```

**Mobile Responsive Rules:**
- Nav row below header: inline links or hamburger
- User icon ALWAYS in header (never in menu)
- Menu slides from right edge
- Touch-friendly: minimum 44x44px tap targets
- Overlay closes menu on tap

**No Fixed/Pinned Elements (NON-NEGOTIABLE):**
- Header, nav, footer all scroll with page
- NOTHING pinned/fixed to viewport
- User scrolls down → header/nav scroll away
- User scrolls to bottom → footer appears

**Footer Position (NON-NEGOTIABLE):**
- Footer ALWAYS at bottom of page (not floating in middle)
- If content is short → footer still at bottom of viewport
- If content is long → footer below content (scroll to see)
- Use min-height layout to push footer down

```css
/* Footer at bottom, no fixed elements */
body {
  display: flex;
  flex-direction: column;
  min-height: 100vh;
}

main {
  flex: 1;  /* Grows to push footer to bottom */
}

/* NO position: fixed or position: sticky on header/nav/footer */
```

**Footer contains (informational links):**
- Standard pages: About, Privacy, Contact, Help
- External links: GitHub
- Branding: project name, version, copyright

**Rule:** Every page template MUST include header, nav, and footer partials. No page may define its own header/nav/footer - use the shared partials only. This ensures:
- Consistent branding across all pages
- Single point of change for navigation updates
- Uniform user experience

**App-Specific Partials (Optional):**

Projects can create additional partials for functionality unique to that application. Place these in `partials/` alongside the mandatory ones.

| Example Partial | Project | Purpose |
|-----------------|---------|---------|
| `search-box.tmpl` | airports, jokes | Reusable search form component |
| `airport-card.tmpl` | airports | Airport info display card |
| `joke-card.tmpl` | jokes | Joke display with copy button |
| `map.tmpl` | airports | Embedded map component |
| `passphrase-generator.tmpl` | wordList | Generator form and output |
| `geoip-result.tmpl` | airports | GeoIP lookup result display |
| `code-block.tmpl` | gitignore | Syntax-highlighted code display |
| `pagination.tmpl` | any | Reusable pagination controls |
| `filters.tmpl` | any | Search/filter form for lists |
| `stats-card.tmpl` | any | Statistics display card |

**App-Specific Partial Structure:**
```
src/server/templates/
├── partials/
│   ├── header.tmpl         # MANDATORY - site header
│   ├── nav.tmpl            # MANDATORY - navigation
│   ├── footer.tmpl         # MANDATORY - site footer
│   ├── head.tmpl           # MANDATORY - <head> contents
│   ├── scripts.tmpl        # MANDATORY - JS includes
│   ├── search-box.tmpl     # APP-SPECIFIC - search component
│   ├── result-card.tmpl    # APP-SPECIFIC - result display
│   └── pagination.tmpl     # APP-SPECIFIC - pagination controls
```

**Usage in page templates:**
```go
{{ define "content" }}
<div class="search-section">
  {{ template "search-box" . }}
</div>

<div class="results">
  {{ range .Results }}
    {{ template "result-card" . }}
  {{ end }}
</div>

{{ template "pagination" .Pagination }}
{{ end }}
```

**Guidelines for app-specific partials:**
- Create a partial when the same HTML is used in 2+ places
- Keep partials focused on one component/purpose
- Pass only the data the partial needs
- Name clearly: `{thing}-{purpose}.tmpl` (e.g., `airport-card.tmpl`, `joke-list.tmpl`)

**Embedding Templates (NON-NEGOTIABLE):**

All templates and static assets MUST be embedded in the binary:

```go
package server

import "embed"

//go:embed templates/*.tmpl templates/**/*.tmpl
var templatesFS embed.FS

//go:embed static/*
var staticFS embed.FS
```

**Template Usage:**
```go
{{ define "base" }}
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>{{ template "head" . }}</head>
<body>
  {{ template "header" . }}
  {{ template "nav" . }}
  <main>{{ template "content" . }}</main>
  {{ template "footer" . }}
  {{ template "scripts" . }}
</body>
</html>
{{ end }}
```

### Embedded vs External Assets

| Type | Embedded in Binary | External (Downloaded) |
|------|-------------------|----------------------|
| Templates (`.tmpl`) | YES | NO |
| CSS files | YES | NO |
| JavaScript files | YES | NO |
| Images/Icons | YES | NO |
| Fonts | YES | NO |
| Application data (JSON) | YES | NO |
| GeoIP databases | NO | YES - downloaded on first run |
| Blocklists | NO | YES - downloaded on first run |
| SSL certificates | NO | YES - only when using ports 80,443 |

**External Data Rules:**
- Security-related data that needs frequent updates is NOT embedded
- Downloaded automatically on first run
- Updated automatically via built-in scheduler
- Scheduler updates configurable via admin panel
- SSL certificates only generated/managed when running on ports `80,443`

**Benefits:**
- Single static binary deployment
- No external file dependencies at runtime
- Consistent layout across all pages
- Reusable components (DRY principle)
- Auto-escaping for security (XSS prevention)

### CSS Rules

| Bad | Good |
|-----|------|
| `<div style="color: red;">` | `<div class="error-text">` |
| `style="margin: 10px;"` | `class="spacing-sm"` |

**All styles MUST be in CSS files, not HTML elements.**

### Frontend UI Elements (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

**NEVER use default JavaScript UI elements. ALWAYS use custom styled components.**

| NEVER Use | ALWAYS Use Instead |
|-----------|---------------------|
| `alert()` | Custom modal with CSS classes |
| `confirm()` | Custom confirmation modal |
| `prompt()` | Custom input modal or inline form |
| Plain text inputs for options | Dropdowns (`<select>`) |
| Plain text for yes/no | Checkboxes or toggle switches |
| Plain text for multiple options | Radio buttons or dropdown |
| Inline text entry | Only when truly needed (search, names, etc.) |

**UI Element Guidelines:**

| Element | When to Use |
|---------|-------------|
| **Dropdown (`<select>`)** | Selecting from predefined options |
| **Checkbox** | Boolean on/off, enable/disable |
| **Toggle Switch** | Boolean with visual feedback |
| **Radio Buttons** | Mutually exclusive options (2-5 choices) |
| **Dropdown** | Mutually exclusive options (>5 choices) |
| **Multi-select** | Multiple selections from list |
| **Text Input** | Free-form text (names, URLs, search) |
| **Textarea** | Multi-line free-form text |
| **Number Input** | Numeric values with spin buttons |
| **Date/Time Picker** | Date and time selection |
| **Color Picker** | Color selection |
| **File Upload** | File selection with drag-drop |

**Modal Requirements:**
- Custom CSS-styled modals (no browser defaults)
- Backdrop overlay
- Close button (X) in corner
- Click outside to close (optional, configurable)
- Escape key to close
- Focus trap (tab stays within modal)
- Animated entrance/exit
- **Auto-close on action** - clicking any action button (OK, Yes, No, Cancel, Save, Delete, Submit, etc.) automatically closes the modal after performing the action. User should never need to click an action then manually close.

**Toast/Notification Requirements:**
- Non-blocking notifications
- Auto-dismiss with configurable timeout
- Manual dismiss option
- Stacking for multiple notifications
- Types: success, error, warning, info
- Icon + message format

## Layout

| Screen Size | Width |
|-------------|-------|
| ≥ 720px | 90% (5% margins) |
| < 720px | 98% (1% margins) |
| Footer | Always centered, always at bottom |

## Themes

| Theme | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **Dark** | Based on Dracula - **DEFAULT** |
| **Light** | Based on popular light theme |
| **Auto** | Based on user's system |

## Branding & SEO (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

**White labeling is cosmetic only - it changes what users see, not how the system works.**

### What Branding Changes

| Changes (User-Visible) | Does NOT Change (System) |
|------------------------|--------------------------|
| Page titles | Directory names (`casci/`) |
| Browser tab | System username (`casci`) |
| Header/logo text | Log filenames |
| Footer branding | Config paths |
| Email "From" name | Binary name |
| SEO meta tags | API routes |
| OpenGraph data | Service names |
| Swagger UI title | Container names |

### Configuration

```yaml
server:
  branding:
    title: "casci"           # Display name (e.g., "Jokes API")
    tagline: ""                      # Short slogan (e.g., "The best jokes API")
    description: ""                  # Longer description for SEO/about

  seo:
    # Project-specific - define per app
    keywords: []                     # e.g., ["jokes", "api", "humor", "free api"]
    author: ""                       # Author/organization name
    og_image: ""                     # OpenGraph image URL for social sharing
    twitter_handle: ""               # Twitter @handle for cards
```

### Where Branding Is Used

| Field | Used In |
|-------|---------|
| `title` | `<title>` tag, header, emails, footer, Swagger UI |
| `tagline` | Homepage hero section, meta description fallback |
| `description` | Meta description, OpenGraph description, about page |
| `keywords` | Meta keywords tag |
| `author` | Meta author tag |
| `og_image` | OpenGraph/Twitter card image |
| `twitter_handle` | Twitter card attribution |

### SEO Meta Tags (Generated)

```html
<head>
  <title>{title} - {tagline}</title>
  <meta name="description" content="{description}">
  <meta name="keywords" content="{keywords}">
  <meta name="author" content="{author}">

  <!-- OpenGraph -->
  <meta property="og:title" content="{title}">
  <meta property="og:description" content="{description}">
  <meta property="og:image" content="{og_image}">
  <meta property="og:type" content="website">
  <meta property="og:url" content="{current_url}">

  <!-- Twitter Card -->
  <meta name="twitter:card" content="summary_large_image">
  <meta name="twitter:title" content="{title}">
  <meta name="twitter:description" content="{description}">
  <meta name="twitter:image" content="{og_image}">
  <meta name="twitter:site" content="{twitter_handle}">
</head>
```

### Admin Panel (/admin/server/branding)

| Element | Type | Description |
|---------|------|-------------|
| Title | Text input | Application display name |
| Tagline | Text input | Short slogan |
| Description | Textarea | Longer description for SEO |
| Keywords | Tag input | SEO keywords (comma-separated) |
| Author | Text input | Author/organization |
| OG Image | File upload / URL | Social sharing image |
| Twitter Handle | Text input | @handle |
| Favicon | File upload / URL | Custom favicon |
| Logo | File upload / URL | Custom logo (header) |

### Image Sources

**Logo, favicon, and OG image can be from local file or remote URL.**

| Source | Format | Example |
|--------|--------|---------|
| Local file | File upload | Upload via admin panel |
| Remote URL | URL input | `https://example.com/logo.png` |
| Embedded default | - | Built-in fallback |

### Image Scaling

**Images are automatically scaled/resized as needed:**

| Image | Sizes Generated |
|-------|-----------------|
| Logo | Original, 200px width (header), 50px width (mobile) |
| Favicon | 16x16, 32x32, 48x48, 180x180 (apple-touch-icon), 192x192, 512x512 |
| OG Image | Original, 1200x630 (OpenGraph standard) |

**Scaling Rules:**

    type: warning
    # warning, info, error, success
    title: "Scheduled Maintenance"
    message: "The system will be down for maintenance on Jan 15, 2025 from 2-4 AM UTC."
    start: "2025-01-14T00:00:00Z"
    # When to start showing
    end: "2025-01-15T04:00:00Z"

### Configuration

```yaml
web:
  # CORS origin configuration
  # - "*": Allow all origins (default)
  # - "https://example.com": Single origin
  # - "https://example.com,https://app.example.com": Multiple origins (comma-separated)
  # - "": Disable CORS headers entirely
  cors: "*"
```

### CORS Headers

| Header | Value |
|--------|-------|
| `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` | Configured origin(s) or `*` |
| `Access-Control-Allow-Methods` | `GET, POST, PUT, PATCH, DELETE, OPTIONS` |
| `Access-Control-Allow-Headers` | `Content-Type, Authorization, X-Request-ID, X-CSRF-Token` |
| `Access-Control-Allow-Credentials` | `true` (only when specific origin, not `*`) |
| `Access-Control-Max-Age` | `86400` (24 hours) |

### Behavior

| Scenario | Behavior |
|----------|----------|
| `cors: "*"` | Allow all origins, credentials NOT allowed |
| `cors: "https://example.com"` | Allow single origin, credentials allowed |
| `cors: "https://a.com,https://b.com"` | Allow listed origins, credentials allowed |
| `cors: ""` | No CORS headers (same-origin only) |
| Preflight (OPTIONS) | Return CORS headers, 204 No Content |

### Mode-Specific Behavior

| Production | Configured value | Strict - only configured origins allowed |
| Development | `*` | Permissive - allows all for easier testing |

### Admin Panel (/admin/server/web)

| Element | Type | Description |
|---------|------|-------------|
| CORS Origins | Text input | Comma-separated list of allowed origins |
| Allow All | Toggle | Quick toggle for `*` (all origins) |
| Preview | Read-only | Shows resulting CORS headers |

## CSRF Protection (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

**ALL forms MUST have CSRF protection.**

### Configuration

```yaml
web:
  csrf:
    enabled: true
    # Token length in bytes

## Template Storage

| Type | Location |
|------|----------|
| Default templates | Embedded in binary (`src/templates/email/`) |
| Custom templates | `{config_dir}/templates/email/` |

**Behavior:**
- If custom template exists → use custom
- If not → fall back to embedded default
- Reset to default → delete custom file

## Default Templates

## Notification Routing (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

**Two notification systems available - use the right one for each event.**

| System | Use When |
|--------|----------|
| **WebUI (Toast/Banner)** | User is actively using the app |
| **Email** | User is away, needs permanent record, critical alerts |

### Routing Rules

| Event | WebUI | Email | Reason |
|-------|:-----:|:-----:|--------|
| Vanity address ready | ✓ | ✗ | User initiated, likely watching |
| Backup complete | ✓ | Optional | Quick confirmation, not critical |
| Backup failed | ✓ | ✓ | Critical - needs attention |
| SSL expiring (7+ days) | ✓ | ✗ | Warning, not urgent |
| SSL expiring (<3 days) | ✓ | ✓ | Urgent - needs action |
| SSL renewed | ✓ | ✗ | Informational |
| Login from new IP | ✓ | ✓ | Security - permanent record |
| Security alert | ✓ | ✓ | Critical - needs record |
| Scheduler task failed | ✓ | ✓ | Needs attention when away |
| Scheduler task success | ✗ | ✗ | No notification needed |
| Settings saved | ✓ | ✗ | Immediate feedback only |
| Password changed | ✓ | ✓ | Security - confirmation |
| Token regenerated | ✓ | ✓ | Security - confirmation |
| Tor address regenerated | ✓ | ✗ | User initiated |
| Update available | ✓ | Optional | Informational |
| Update installed | ✓ | ✓ | Important change record |

### Decision Logic

```
1. Is user actively using the app?
   → Always show WebUI notification

2. Is it critical (failure, security, urgent)?
   → Send email

3. Does user need a record when away?
   → Send email

4. Is it just confirmation of user action?
   → WebUI only (no email)

5. Is it routine success?
   → No notification needed
```

### WebUI Notification Types

| Type | Use For | Auto-dismiss |
|------|---------|--------------|
| `success` | Completed actions, confirmations | 5 seconds |
| `info` | Informational, status updates | 5 seconds |
| `warning` | Non-critical issues, expiring items | 10 seconds |
| `error` | Failures, critical issues | Manual dismiss |
| `persistent` | Requires action (e.g., "Apply vanity address") | Manual dismiss |

### WebUI Banner vs Toast

| Element | Use For |
|---------|---------|
| **Toast** | Transient notifications (success, info, warnings) |
| **Banner** | Persistent alerts requiring action (update available, SSL expiring soon) |

## Configuration

```yaml
server:
  notifications:
    # WebUI notifications (always enabled)
    webui:
      position: top-right
      # top-right, top-left, bottom-right, bottom-left
      duration: 5
      # seconds (0 = manual dismiss)

    # Email notifications
    email:
      enabled: false

      # Auto-detect SMTP server on local network
      autodetect: true
      autodetect_hosts:
        - localhost
        - 172.17.0.1
      autodetect_ports:
        - 25
        - 465
        - 587

      # Manual SMTP settings (used if autodetect disabled or fails)
      smtp:
        host: ""
        port: 587
        username: ""
        password: ""
        from: "noreply@{fqdn}"
        # TLS mode: auto, required, none
        tls: auto

      # Per-event email settings (override defaults)
      events:
        startup: false
        shutdown: false
        backup_complete: false
        backup_failed: true
        ssl_expiring: true
        ssl_renewed: false
        login_alert: true
        security_alert: true
        scheduler_error: true
        password_changed: true
        token_regenerated: true
        update_available: false

```

### Commands Anyone Can Run (No Privileges)

- `--help`
- `--version`
- `--status`
- `--update check`

## Display Rules (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

| Rule | Description |
|------|-------------|
| Never show | `0.0.0.0`, `127.0.0.1`, `localhost` |
| Always show | Valid FQDN, host, or IP |
| Show only | One address, the most relevant |

## URL & FQDN Detection (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

**CRITICAL: Never hardcode host, IP, or port in project code. Always detect dynamically.**

### URL Display Rules

| Rule | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **NEVER hardcode** | `localhost`, `127.0.0.1`, `0.0.0.0`, `[::1]`, any static host/IP |
| **NEVER display** | `GET /api/`, `POST /api/` without full URL |
| **ALWAYS use** | `{proto}://{host}:{port}/path` format |
| **ALWAYS detect** | `{proto}`, `{host}`, `{port}` from request context |
| **ALWAYS strip** | `:80` for HTTP, `:443` for HTTPS |
| **Default proto** | `http` if not detected |

### URL Format Examples

| WRONG | RIGHT |
|-------|-------|
| `GET /api/v1/resource/random` | `https://api.example.com/api/v1/resource/random` |
| `POST /api/v1/admin/config` | `https://api.example.com/api/v1/admin/config` |
| `http://localhost:8080/api` | `http://192.168.1.100:64580/api` |
| `http://0.0.0.0:80/healthz` | `https://myserver.example.com/healthz` |

### FQDN Detection Order (First Valid Wins)

| Priority | Source | Description |
|----------|--------|-------------|
| 1 | **Reverse Proxy Headers** | `X-Forwarded-Host`, `X-Real-Host`, etc. |
| 2 | **DOMAIN env var** | Must be valid FQDN (e.g., `api.example.com`) |
| 3 | **HOSTNAME env var** | Must be valid FQDN (e.g., `host.example.com`) |
| 4 | **Global IPv6** | If available and routable |
| 5 | **Global IPv4** | If available and routable |

### FQDN/Host Validation Rules

Validation depends on application mode:

**Production Mode (Strict):**

| Valid | Invalid |
|-------|---------|
| `api.example.com` | `localhost` |
| `my-host.domain.org` | `dev.local` |
| `server.company.io` | `app.test` |
| | `192.168.1.1` (IP address) |
| | `myhost` (single-label) |

**Development Mode (Relaxed):**

| Valid | Invalid |
|-------|---------|
| `api.example.com` | `192.168.1.1` (IP address) |
| `localhost` | `myhost` (single-label, not localhost) |
| `dev.local` | `devbox` (single-label) |
| `app.test` | |
| `staging.internal` | |

**Validation Requirements:**

| Mode | Rules |
|------|-------|
| **Production** | Must have dot, no IPs, no internal TLDs, no localhost |
| **Development** | Must have dot OR be localhost, no IPs |

**Internal/Dev-Only TLDs:**
- `localhost` (literal)
- `.localhost`, `.test`, `.example`, `.invalid` (RFC 6761)
- `.local`, `.lan`, `.internal`, `.home`, `.localdomain`
- `.home.arpa`, `.intranet`, `.corp`, `.private`

**Special TLDs (Always Valid):**
- `.onion` - Tor hidden services (RFC 7686)

**Go Implementation:**
```go
var devOnlyTLDs = []string{
    ".localhost", ".test", ".example", ".invalid",
    ".local", ".lan", ".internal", ".home", ".localdomain",
    ".home.arpa", ".intranet", ".corp", ".private",
}

func IsValidHost(host string, devMode bool) bool {
    lower := strings.ToLower(host)

    // Reject IP addresses always
    if net.ParseIP(host) != nil {
        return false
    }

    // Handle localhost
    if lower == "localhost" {
        return devMode // Only valid in dev mode
    }

    // Must contain at least one dot
    if !strings.Contains(host, ".") {
        return false
    }

    // .onion addresses are always valid (Tor hidden services)
    if strings.HasSuffix(lower, ".onion") {
        return true
    }

    // In production, reject dev-only TLDs
    if !devMode {
        for _, tld := range devOnlyTLDs {
            if strings.HasSuffix(lower, tld) {
                return false
            }
        }
    }

    return true
}
```

**Note:** DOMAIN and HOSTNAME environment variables MUST pass host validation for the current mode. Invalid values are skipped silently and detection continues to next source.

### SSL/Let's Encrypt FQDN Requirements

When requesting SSL certificates (Let's Encrypt), the FQDN must be **publicly resolvable**. This uses the same validation as production mode - no internal/dev-only TLDs allowed.

**Go Implementation for SSL validation:**
```go
func IsValidSSLHost(host string) bool {
    lower := strings.ToLower(host)

    // .onion addresses cannot use Let's Encrypt (not publicly resolvable)
    // Tor provides end-to-end encryption, so SSL is optional for .onion
    if strings.HasSuffix(lower, ".onion") {
        return false
    }

    // SSL always requires production-valid host (devMode=false)
    return IsValidHost(host, false)
}
```

**Behavior:**
- SSL with Let's Encrypt: Must pass production-mode validation (no dev TLDs)
- .onion addresses: Cannot use Let's Encrypt (Tor provides encryption)
- If Let's Encrypt requested with invalid host: Log warning, skip cert request, continue without SSL
- Self-signed certs: Can use any valid host for current mode

### Reverse Proxy Header Support (All Headers Supported)

**Protocol Detection (`{proto}`):**
- `X-Forwarded-Proto` - Standard: "https" or "http"
- `X-Forwarded-Ssl` - "on" = https, "off" = http
- `X-Url-Scheme` - Alternative: "https" or "http"
- `Front-End-Https` - Microsoft: "on" = https

**Host Detection (`{host}`):**
- `X-Forwarded-Host` - Standard: "example.com" or "example.com:8080"
- `X-Real-Host` - nginx: "example.com"
- `X-Original-Host` - Alternative

**Port Detection (`{port}`):**
- `X-Forwarded-Port` - Standard: "443" or "8080"
- `X-Real-Port` - nginx alternative

**Client IP Detection (for logging, rate limiting, GeoIP):**
- `X-Forwarded-For` - Standard: may contain chain "client, proxy1, proxy2"
- `X-Real-IP` - nginx: single IP
- `CF-Connecting-IP` - Cloudflare
- `True-Client-IP` - Akamai/Cloudflare Enterprise
- `X-Client-IP` - Alternative

**Request ID (for tracing):**
- `X-Request-ID` - Standard
- `X-Correlation-ID` - Alternative
- `X-Trace-ID` - Distributed tracing

### Request ID Handling (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

**Every request MUST have a Request ID for tracing and debugging.**

| Scenario | Behavior |
|----------|----------|
| Client sends `X-Request-ID` | Use client's ID (validate format) |
| No Request ID header | Generate new UUID |
| Invalid format | Generate new UUID, log warning |

**Request ID Rules:**

| Rule | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **Format** | UUID v4 (e.g., `550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000`) |
| **Generation** | Use secure random UUID generator |
| **Propagation** | Include in all outgoing requests to downstream services |
| **Response** | Return `X-Request-ID` in response headers |
| **Logging** | Include `{request_id}` in all log entries for the request |

**Go Implementation:**
```go
func RequestIDMiddleware(next http.Handler) http.Handler {
    return http.HandlerFunc(func(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
        // Check for existing request ID from client or upstream proxy
        requestID := r.Header.Get("X-Request-ID")
        if requestID == "" {
            requestID = r.Header.Get("X-Correlation-ID")
        }
        if requestID == "" {
            requestID = r.Header.Get("X-Trace-ID")
        }

        // Generate new ID if none provided or invalid
        if requestID == "" || !isValidUUID(requestID) {
            requestID = uuid.New().String()
        }

        // Add to response headers
        w.Header().Set("X-Request-ID", requestID)

        // Add to request context for logging and downstream calls
        ctx := context.WithValue(r.Context(), "request_id", requestID)
        next.ServeHTTP(w, r.WithContext(ctx))
    })
}
```

### Implementation Requirements

1. **Request Context Helper**: Create a helper function that extracts `{proto}`, `{host}`, `{port}` from each request
2. **URL Builder**: Create a helper that builds full URLs: `{proto}://{host}:{port}/path` (strip :80/:443)
3. **Never Import** hardcoded URLs into templates - always pass detected values
4. **API Response URLs**: All URLs in API responses must be absolute, using detected values
5. **Swagger/OpenAPI**: Server URL must be detected, not hardcoded

    curl \
    bash \
    tini \
    tor

# Copy the static binary
COPY casci /usr/local/bin/casci
RUN chmod +x /usr/local/bin/casci

# Create directories
RUN mkdir -p /config /data

# Set environment
ENV MODE=development

# Expose port
EXPOSE 80

# Use tini as init
ENTRYPOINT ["/sbin/tini", "--"]

# Run the application
CMD ["/usr/local/bin/casci"]
```

## Docker Compose Requirements

| Requirement | Value |
|-------------|-------|
| Build definition | NEVER include |

| Network | Custom `casci` network |
| Container name | `casci` |
| **environment: MODE** | **production** (strict host validation) |

### Docker Compose Example

```yaml
services:
  casci:
    image: ghcr.io/casapps/casci:latest
    container_name: casci
    restart: unless-stopped
    environment:
      - MODE=production
    ports:
      - "8080:80"
    volumes:
      - ./config:/config

---

# PART 22: BINARY REQUIREMENTS (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

## Single Static Binary

| Requirement | Description |
|-------------|-------------|
| Type | **SINGLE STATIC BINARY** |
| Assets | Embedded using Go's `embed` package |
| Dependencies | None at runtime |
| Build | **CGO_ENABLED=0** |
| Libraries | Pure Go only (no CGO) |

## Default Behavior

| Behavior | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| No arguments | Initialize (if needed) and start server |
| First run | Auto-create config with defaults |
| First run | Auto-create required directories |
| Signals | Proper handling (SIGTERM, SIGINT, SIGHUP) |
| PID file | Enabled by default |

---

# PART 23: TESTING & DEVELOPMENT (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

## Temporary Directory Structure (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

**Format:** `/tmp/{orgname}-{purpose}/casci/`

| Purpose | Path | Example |
|---------|------|---------|
| Build output | `/tmp/apimgr-build/casci/` | `/tmp/apimgr-build/jokes/` |
| Test config | `/tmp/apimgr-test/casci/` | `/tmp/apimgr-test/jokes/` |
| Debug files | `/tmp/apimgr-debug/casci/` | `/tmp/apimgr-debug/jokes/` |
| Runtime temp | `/tmp/apimgr-runtime/casci/` | `/tmp/apimgr-runtime/jokes/` |

### Rules

| Rule | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **NEVER** | Use `/tmp/casci` directly |
| **NEVER** | Use `/tmp/` root for project files |
| **ALWAYS** | Use `/tmp/{orgname}-{purpose}/casci/` format |
| **ALWAYS** | Include organization prefix to avoid conflicts |
| **ALWAYS** | Include purpose subdirectory for organization |

### Why This Structure?

| Reason | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Avoid conflicts** | Multiple projects/orgs won't collide |
| **Easy cleanup** | `rm -rf /tmp/apimgr-*` cleans all org temp files |
| **Clear purpose** | Directory name shows what files are for |
| **Debugging** | Easy to find specific project's temp files |

### Correct vs Incorrect

| WRONG | RIGHT |
|-------|-------|
| `/tmp/jokes` | `/tmp/apimgr-build/jokes/` |
| `/tmp/build/jokes` | `/tmp/apimgr-build/jokes/` |
| `/tmp/test` | `/tmp/apimgr-test/jokes/` |
| `/tmp/jokes-test` | `/tmp/apimgr-test/jokes/` |

## Container Usage (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

**ALL builds, tests, and debugging MUST use containerized environments. NEVER build directly on the host system.**

| Rule | Description |
|------|-------------|
| Build environment | Docker/Incus/LXD |
| Image | `golang:latest` (NOT alpine) |
| Test binaries | Temp directories |
| **NEVER** | Run `go build` directly on host |
| **ALWAYS** | Use containerized build command below |

### Why Containerized Builds?

| Reason | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Consistent environment** | Same Go version and dependencies across all builds |
| **Static binaries** | `CGO_ENABLED=0` produces binaries with no runtime dependencies |
| **Reproducible** | Builds work regardless of host OS setup |
| **Clean isolation** | No pollution of host system with build artifacts |

## Build Command (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

**This is the REQUIRED build command. Not an example - this MUST be used.**

```bash
docker run --rm -v /path/to/project:/build -w /build -e CGO_ENABLED=0 \
  golang:latest go build -o /tmp/apimgr-build/casci/casci ./src
```

### Testing a Built Binary

```bash
# Build
docker run --rm -v /root/Projects/github/apimgr/casci:/build -w /build \
  -e CGO_ENABLED=0 golang:latest go build -o /tmp/apimgr-build/casci/casci ./src

# Run/Test
/tmp/apimgr-build/casci/casci --help
/tmp/apimgr-build/casci/casci --version
```

## Process Management (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

**STRICT RULES: Only kill/remove the EXACT process or container being worked on. NEVER anything else.**

### FORBIDDEN Commands (NEVER Use)

| Command | Reason |
|---------|--------|
| `pkill -f {pattern}` | Too broad, kills unrelated processes |
| `pkill {name}` | Too broad without `-x` flag |
| `killall {name}` | Too broad, may kill unrelated processes |
| `kill -9 {pid}` | Use graceful `kill {pid}` first |
| `docker kill` | Use `docker stop` for graceful shutdown |
| `docker rm $(docker ps -aq)` | Removes ALL containers |
| `docker rm $(docker ps -q)` | Removes ALL running containers |
| `docker rmi $(docker images -q)` | Removes ALL images |
| `docker system prune` | Cleans ALL unused resources |
| `docker container prune` | Removes ALL stopped containers |
| `docker image prune` | Removes ALL dangling images |
| `docker volume prune` | Removes ALL unused volumes |
| `docker network prune` | Removes ALL unused networks |
| `rm -rf /` | Catastrophic |
| `rm -rf /*` | Catastrophic |
| `rm -rf ~` | Destroys home directory |
| `rm -rf .` | Dangerous in wrong directory |
| `rm -rf *` | Dangerous without proper scoping |

### Process Termination Rules

| Rule | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **Identify first** | ALWAYS get exact PID before killing |
| **Graceful first** | Use `kill {pid}` (SIGTERM), wait, then `kill -9 {pid}` only if needed |
| **One at a time** | Kill ONE specific PID, never patterns |
| **Verify PID** | Confirm PID belongs to the project process |
| **Document** | Log what was killed and why |

**Kill Process Flow:**
```
1. pgrep -la casci           # List matching processes
2. Verify the PID is correct          # CHECK before killing
3. kill {pid}                         # Graceful termination (SIGTERM)
4. sleep 5                            # Wait for graceful shutdown
5. pgrep -la casci           # Check if still running
6. kill -9 {pid}                      # Force kill ONLY if still running
```

### Docker Container Rules

| Rule | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **ONLY this project** | Only stop/remove containers named `casci` |
| **NEVER other containers** | Even if they look related or unused |
| **NEVER images not ours** | Only remove `casapps/casci:*` images |
| **NEVER base images** | Never remove `golang`, `alpine`, `ubuntu`, etc. |
| **NEVER volumes** | Unless explicitly part of this project |

**Docker Cleanup Flow:**
```
1. docker ps -a --filter name=casci     # List ONLY this project's containers
2. Verify output shows ONLY casci       # CHECK before removing
3. docker stop casci                    # Stop gracefully
4. docker rm casci                      # Remove container

# For images:
1. docker images casapps/casci     # List ONLY this project's images
2. Verify output shows ONLY our images          # CHECK before removing
3. docker rmi casapps/casci:tag    # Remove SPECIFIC tag
```

### Allowed Commands (Project-Scoped ONLY)

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `kill {specific-pid}` | Kill exact PID only (after verification) |
| `pkill -x casci` | Exact binary name match only |
| `docker stop casci` | Stop specific container by name |
| `docker rm casci` | Remove specific container by name |
| `docker rmi casapps/casci:tag` | Remove specific image:tag |
| `rm -rf /tmp/apimgr-build/casci/` | Remove specific project temp files |
| `rm -rf /tmp/apimgr-*/casci/` | Remove all temp files for one project |

### Before ANY Kill/Remove Operation

1. **List first**: See exactly what will be affected
2. **Verify**: Confirm it's the correct process/container/file
3. **Be specific**: Use exact names, PIDs, or paths - NEVER patterns
4. **Ask if unsure**: When in doubt, ask the user
5. **Document**: Log what was removed and why

## File Cleanup Rules (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

**Always be explicit and project-scoped when deleting files.**

### Safe Cleanup Commands

| Purpose | Command |
|---------|---------|
| Project build temp | `rm -rf /tmp/apimgr-build/casci/` |
| Project test temp | `rm -rf /tmp/apimgr-test/casci/` |
| Project debug temp | `rm -rf /tmp/apimgr-debug/casci/` |
| All project temp | `rm -rf /tmp/apimgr-*/casci/` |
| All org temp | `rm -rf /tmp/apimgr-*/` |
| Project binaries | `rm -rf ./binaries/casci*` |
| Project releases | `rm -rf ./releases/casci*` |

### NEVER Delete Without Confirmation

| Item | Why |
|------|-----|
| User data directories | Irreversible data loss |
| Config files | User customizations lost |
| Database files | Data loss |
| SSL certificates | Service disruption |
| Git repositories | Code loss |
| Anything outside project scope | Affects other systems |

### Cleanup Checklist

Before running any `rm -rf`:

1. **Echo first**: `echo "Would delete: /path/to/delete"` - verify the path
2. **Check pwd**: `pwd` - make sure you're in the right directory
3. **List first**: `ls -la /path/to/delete` - see what will be deleted
4. **Be specific**: Use full paths, not relative paths with wildcards
5. **Ask if unsure**: When in doubt, ask the user before deleting

### Log Output Rules (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

**All log FILES MUST use raw text only:**
- NO emojis
- NO ANSI color codes
- NO special characters or formatting
- Plain ASCII text only
- Machine-parseable format

**Console output (stdout/stderr) CAN be pretty:**
- Emojis allowed (e.g., `✅ Server started`, `❌ Error`, `⚠️ Warning`)
- ANSI colors allowed
- Pretty formatting allowed
- Used for start/stop/restart/status messages
- User-facing CLI output can be visually appealing

**Rule:** Log files = raw/plain text. Console = pretty is OK.

### Log Rotation

**Defaults:**
| Log Type | Rotation | Keep |
|----------|----------|------|
| access.log | monthly | none |
| All others | weekly,50MB | none |

**Rules:**
- `weekly,50MB` = rotate on weekly OR 50MB, whichever comes first
- `keep: none` = do not retain old logs (default)
- Built-in rotation support (no external logrotate needed)
- Old logs deleted immediately after rotation (default)
- Optional: compress before delete, retain with `keep: weekly:N` or `monthly:N`

# PART 31: USER MANAGEMENT (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

## Overview

**Projects can operate in two modes: admin-only or multi-user.**

| Mode | Use Case | Default |
|------|----------|---------|
| **Admin-only** | Simple APIs (jokes, quotes, etc.) - just admin account | YES |
| **Multi-user** | Apps needing user accounts, registration, profiles, API tokens | NO |

## Server Admin vs Regular Users (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

**The server admin is a SYSTEM ACCOUNT, not a regular user.**

| Account Type | Storage | Login | Access |
|--------------|---------|-------|--------|
| **Server Admin** | Config file (`server.yml`) | `/auth/login` | `/admin/*` only |
| **Regular Users** | Database (users table) | `/auth/login` | `/user/*` routes |

### Server Admin Behavior

| Route | Server Admin Access |
|-------|---------------------|
| `/admin/*` | Full access |
| `/user/*` | NO - treated as guest (redirect to `/admin`) |
| `/auth/login` | Login page |
| `/auth/logout` | Logout |
| Public routes (`/`, `/server/*`, etc.) | Guest view (no user-specific content) |

**Server Admin Credentials:**
- Stored in `server.yml` (username, hashed password)
- Managed via `/admin/server/settings` (NOT `/user/profile`)
- NOT in the users database table
- Single account per instance

### Regular User Behavior

| Route | Regular User Access |
|-------|---------------------|
| `/admin/*` | NO - 403 Forbidden (unless user has admin role) |
| `/user/*` | Full access to own profile, settings, tokens |
| `/auth/login` | Login page |
| `/auth/logout` | Logout |
| Public routes | Authenticated view (may show user-specific content) |

**Regular User Accounts:**
- Stored in database (users table)
- Managed via `/user/profile`, `/user/settings`
- Can have roles (admin, user, custom)
- Multiple accounts supported

### Why This Separation?

| Reason | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Security** | Server admin has system-level access, not app-level |
| **Simplicity** | Admin-only mode doesn't need user management |
| **Isolation** | Server admin credentials separate from user data |
| **Recovery** | Can access admin even if database is corrupted |

## Configuration

```yaml
server:
  users:
    # Enable multi-user mode (default: disabled = admin-only)
    enabled: false

    registration:
      # Allow public registration
      enabled: false
      # Require email verification before account is active
      require_email_verification: true
      # Admin must approve new users
      require_approval: false
      # Allowed email domains (empty = all allowed)
      allowed_domains: []
      # Blocked email domains
      blocked_domains: []

    roles:
      # Available roles
      available:
        - admin
        - user
      # Default role for new users
      default: user

    tokens:
      # Allow users to generate API tokens
      enabled: true
      # Maximum tokens per user
      max_per_user: 5
      # Token expiration (0 = never)
      expiration_days: 0

    profile:
      # Allow users to upload avatars
      allow_avatar: true
      # Allow users to set display name
      allow_display_name: true
      # Allow users to set bio
      allow_bio: true

    auth:
      # Session duration
      session_duration: 30d
      # Require 2FA for all users
      require_2fa: false
      # Allow 2FA (user choice)
      allow_2fa: true
      # Password requirements
      password_min_length: 8
      password_require_uppercase: false
      password_require_number: false
      password_require_special: false

    limits:
      # Rate limits per user (0 = use global)
      requests_per_minute: 0
      requests_per_day: 0
```

## User Roles & Permissions

| Role | Description | Default Permissions |
|------|-------------|---------------------|
| `admin` | Full access | All permissions |
| `user` | Standard user | Read, own profile, own API tokens |

### Custom Roles

Projects can define custom roles with specific permissions:

```yaml
server:
  users:
    roles:
      available:
        - admin
        - moderator
        - user
        - readonly
      default: user
      permissions:
        moderator:
          - read
          - write
          - moderate
        readonly:
          - read
```

## User Features

### Registration Flow

```
1. User submits registration form
   ├─ If require_email_verification: Send verification email
   │   └─ User clicks link → account verified
   ├─ If require_approval: Admin notified
   │   └─ Admin approves → account active
   └─ If neither: Account immediately active

2. User can now log in
```

### Authentication Methods

| Method | Use For |
|--------|---------|
| Session (cookie) | Web interface |
| API token | API access (passed as Bearer token in Authorization header) |

# PART 32: TOR HIDDEN SERVICE (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

## Overview

**ALL projects MUST have built-in Tor hidden service support.**

Tor integration uses **external Tor binary** via `github.com/cretz/bine`. This maintains `CGO_ENABLED=0` compatibility for static binaries while providing full Tor hidden service functionality.

## Configuration

```yaml
server:
  tor:
    enabled: true  # Default: enabled
    # Path to Tor binary (auto-detected if empty)
    binary: ""
```

**Notes:**
- Uses external Tor binary (not embedded) for CGO_ENABLED=0 compatibility
- Enabled by default - privacy out of the box
- .onion address derived from keys in `{data_dir}/tor/site/`
- Application manages Tor process lifecycle

## Tor Process Management (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

**The application MUST start its OWN dedicated Tor process. NEVER use system Tor.**

This prevents conflicts with any existing Tor installation on the system.

```
1. Find Tor binary:
   ├─ Check config `server.tor.binary` path
   ├─ Check PATH for `tor` executable
   ├─ Check common locations:
   │   ├─ Linux: /usr/bin/tor, /usr/local/bin/tor
   │   ├─ macOS: /usr/local/bin/tor, /opt/homebrew/bin/tor
   │   ├─ Windows: C:\Program Files\Tor\tor.exe
   │   └─ BSD: /usr/local/bin/tor
   └─ NOT FOUND: Log warning, disable Tor features, continue without Tor

2. Start DEDICATED Tor process:
   ├─ Use application's own DataDir: `{data_dir}/tor/`
   ├─ Use random available ControlPort (not 9051)
   ├─ Use random available SocksPort (not 9050)
   ├─ Completely isolated from system Tor
   ├─ Wait for bootstrap completion
   └─ Create hidden service via ADD_ONION

3. On application shutdown:
   └─ Terminate the dedicated Tor process
```

### Why Dedicated Tor Process?

| Reason | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **No conflicts** | System Tor uses 9050/9051, we use random ports |
| **Isolation** | Our DataDir is separate from system Tor |
| **Clean shutdown** | We control the process lifecycle |
| **No permissions issues** | Don't need access to system Tor control |
| **Predictable behavior** | Always same configuration |

## Implementation

### Library

Use `github.com/cretz/bine` (pure Go, CGO_ENABLED=0 compatible):

```go
import (
    "github.com/cretz/bine/tor"
)

func startDedicatedTor(ctx context.Context, localPort int) (*tor.Tor, *tor.OnionService, error) {
    // Start OUR OWN Tor process - completely separate from system Tor
    t, err := tor.Start(ctx, &tor.StartConf{
        // Our own data directory - isolated from system Tor
        DataDir: paths.GetDataDir() + "/tor",

        // Let bine pick available ports (avoids conflict with system Tor 9050/9051)
        // These are set automatically to available ports
        NoAutoSocksPort: false,

        // Optional: specify path if not in PATH
        // ExePath: "/usr/bin/tor",

        // Debug output (development only)
        // DebugWriter: os.Stderr,
    })
    if err != nil {
        return nil, nil, fmt.Errorf("failed to start dedicated tor: %w", err)
    }

    // Wait for Tor to bootstrap
    dialCtx, cancel := context.WithTimeout(ctx, 3*time.Minute)
    defer cancel()
    if err := t.EnableNetwork(dialCtx, true); err != nil {
        t.Close()
        return nil, nil, fmt.Errorf("failed to enable tor network: %w", err)
    }

    // Create hidden service
    onion, err := t.Listen(ctx, &tor.ListenConf{
        RemotePorts: []int{80},
        LocalPort:   localPort,
    })
    if err != nil {
        t.Close()
        return nil, nil, fmt.Errorf("failed to create onion service: %w", err)
    }

    // onion.ID contains the .onion address (without .onion suffix)
    log.Printf("Tor hidden service started: %s.onion", onion.ID)
    return t, onion, nil
}

// Shutdown cleanly terminates our dedicated Tor process
func shutdownTor(t *tor.Tor) error {
    if t != nil {
        return t.Close()
    }
    return nil
}
```

### Port Allocation

| Port | System Tor | Our Tor |
|------|------------|---------|
| SocksPort | 9050 | Random available |
| ControlPort | 9051 | Random available |
| DataDir | `/var/lib/tor` | `{data_dir}/tor/` |

**bine automatically selects available ports**, ensuring no conflict with system Tor.

### Tor Configuration Optimizations (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

**Tor is used ONLY for hidden services. Optimize accordingly.**

```go
// Optimized torrc settings for hidden-service-only mode
func getTorConfig() string {
    return `
# Hidden service only - not a relay or exit
SocksPort 0
# No SOCKS proxy needed - we're server only

# Disable unused features
ExitRelay 0
ExitPolicy reject *:*
# Never act as exit node

# Don't relay traffic for others
ORPort 0
DirPort 0

# Reduce circuit building (we only need service circuits)
MaxCircuitDirtiness 600
# Keep circuits longer

# Reduce bandwidth for Tor overhead
BandwidthRate 1 MB
BandwidthBurst 2 MB

# Hidden service optimizations
HiddenServiceSingleHopMode 0
# Keep full anonymity (3 hops)

# Faster startup
FetchDirInfoEarly 1
FetchDirInfoExtraEarly 1

# Reduce memory usage
DisableDebuggerAttachment 1
`
}
```

| Setting | Value | Reason |
|---------|-------|--------|
| `SocksPort 0` | Disabled | Not browsing, server only |
| `ExitRelay 0` | Disabled | Not an exit node |
| `ORPort 0` | Disabled | Not relaying traffic |
| `DirPort 0` | Disabled | Not a directory server |
| `ExitPolicy reject *:*` | Block all | Extra safety |
| `MaxCircuitDirtiness 600` | 10 minutes | Keep circuits longer |

### Tor Process Lifecycle (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

**The application MUST fully manage the Tor process lifecycle.**

| Event | Action |
|-------|--------|
| **App Start** | Find Tor binary → Start dedicated Tor process → Wait for bootstrap → Create hidden service |
| **App Running** | Monitor Tor process, restart if crashed |
| **App Shutdown** | Terminate Tor process gracefully (SIGTERM) |
| **App Crash** | Tor process should terminate (child process dies with parent) |
| **SIGTERM/SIGINT** | Graceful shutdown: stop Tor, then exit |
| **SIGHUP** | Reload config, restart Tor if settings changed |

### Tor Restart Triggers (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

**Tor MUST be restarted when these events occur:**

| Trigger | Action | Notes |
|---------|--------|-------|
| **Regenerate .onion address** | Stop Tor → Delete keys → Start Tor | New random address |
| **Apply vanity address** | Stop Tor → Replace keys → Start Tor | Use generated vanity keys |
| **Import external keys** | Stop Tor → Replace keys → Start Tor | Use imported keys |
| **Enable Tor** | Start Tor | Was disabled |
| **Disable Tor** | Stop Tor | User disabled |
| **Tor process crash** | Restart Tor | Auto-recovery |
| **Tor unresponsive** | Stop Tor → Start Tor | Health check failed |
| **Config change** | Stop Tor → Start Tor | Settings changed |

### Restart Implementation

```go
// TorManager handles all Tor lifecycle operations
type TorManager struct {
    mu        sync.Mutex
    tor       *tor.Tor
    onion     *tor.OnionService
    dataDir   string
    localPort int
    ctx       context.Context
    cancel    context.CancelFunc
}

// Restart stops and starts Tor (used for config changes, recovery)
func (tm *TorManager) Restart() error {
    tm.mu.Lock()
    defer tm.mu.Unlock()

    // Stop existing
    if tm.tor != nil {
        tm.tor.Close()
        tm.tor = nil
        tm.onion = nil
    }

    // Start fresh
    return tm.startLocked()
}

// RegenerateAddress creates a new random .onion address
func (tm *TorManager) RegenerateAddress() (string, error) {
    tm.mu.Lock()
    defer tm.mu.Unlock()

    // Stop Tor
    if tm.tor != nil {
        tm.tor.Close()
        tm.tor = nil
        tm.onion = nil
    }

    // Delete existing keys
    keysDir := filepath.Join(tm.dataDir, "site")
    if err := os.RemoveAll(keysDir); err != nil {
        return "", fmt.Errorf("failed to remove old keys: %w", err)
    }

    // Start Tor - new keys will be generated
    if err := tm.startLocked(); err != nil {
        return "", err
    }

    return tm.onion.ID + ".onion", nil
}

// ApplyKeys stops Tor, replaces keys, and restarts
func (tm *TorManager) ApplyKeys(privateKey []byte) (string, error) {
    tm.mu.Lock()
    defer tm.mu.Unlock()

    // Stop Tor
    if tm.tor != nil {
        tm.tor.Close()
        tm.tor = nil
        tm.onion = nil
    }

    // Write new keys
    keysDir := filepath.Join(tm.dataDir, "site")
    os.MkdirAll(keysDir, 0700)
    keyPath := filepath.Join(keysDir, "hs_ed25519_secret_key")
    if err := os.WriteFile(keyPath, privateKey, 0600); err != nil {
        return "", fmt.Errorf("failed to write key: %w", err)
    }

    // Start Tor with new keys
    if err := tm.startLocked(); err != nil {
        return "", err
    }

    return tm.onion.ID + ".onion", nil
}

// SetEnabled enables or disables Tor
func (tm *TorManager) SetEnabled(enabled bool) error {
    tm.mu.Lock()
    defer tm.mu.Unlock()

    if enabled {
        if tm.tor == nil {
            return tm.startLocked()
        }
    } else {
        if tm.tor != nil {
            tm.tor.Close()
            tm.tor = nil
            tm.onion = nil
        }
    }
    return nil
}
```

### Signal Handling with Tor

```go
func main() {
    ctx, cancel := context.WithCancel(context.Background())
    defer cancel()

    // Start Tor
    torProcess, onion, err := startDedicatedTor(ctx, localPort)
    if err != nil {
        log.Printf("Warning: Tor disabled - %v", err)
        // Continue without Tor
    }

    // Handle shutdown signals
    sigChan := make(chan os.Signal, 1)
    signal.Notify(sigChan, syscall.SIGINT, syscall.SIGTERM)

    go func() {
        <-sigChan
        log.Println("Shutting down...")

        // Stop Tor FIRST
        if torProcess != nil {
            log.Println("Stopping Tor process...")
            torProcess.Close()
        }

        // Then cancel context for other goroutines
        cancel()
    }()

    // Run server...
}
```

### Tor Process Monitoring

```go
// Monitor Tor and restart if it crashes
func monitorTor(ctx context.Context, torProcess *tor.Tor, restartFunc func() (*tor.Tor, error)) {
    ticker := time.NewTicker(30 * time.Second)
    defer ticker.Stop()

    for {
        select {
        case <-ctx.Done():
            return
        case <-ticker.C:
            // Check if Tor is still responsive
            if torProcess != nil {
                // Ping control connection
                if _, err := torProcess.Control.GetInfo("version"); err != nil {
                    log.Println("Tor process unresponsive, restarting...")
                    torProcess.Close()
                    newTor, err := restartFunc()
                    if err != nil {
                        log.Printf("Failed to restart Tor: %v", err)
                    } else {
                        torProcess = newTor
                    }
                }
            }
        }
    }
}
```

### Binary Size

No impact on binary size - Tor is external. Application binary remains small and static.

### Data Storage

| Data | Location |
|------|----------|
| Tor data directory | `{data_dir}/tor/` |
| Hidden service keys | `{data_dir}/tor/site/` |
| Tor process PID | `{data_dir}/tor/tor.pid` |

## Admin Panel

### /admin/server/tor (Web UI)

| Element | Type | Description |
|---------|------|-------------|

```

### Vanity Address Generation

**Built-in generation (max 6 characters):**

| Prefix Length | Approximate Time |
|---------------|------------------|
| 1-4 chars | Seconds to minutes |
| 5 chars | Minutes to hours |
| 6 chars | Hours to days |

**Behavior:**
- Generation runs in background
- Current .onion address remains active while generating
- Notification sent when vanity address is ready
- User clicks notification or "Apply" button to activate
- Old keys deleted, new vanity keys activated
- Tor restarts with new address

### External Vanity Generation (7+ characters)

For prefixes longer than 6 characters, use external tools with GPU acceleration. The admin panel includes documentation (expandable help section):

**Using mkp224o (CPU):**
```bash
# Install
git clone https://github.com/cathugger/mkp224o
cd mkp224o && ./autogen.sh && ./configure && make

# Generate (example: 7-char prefix "myapp12")
./mkp224o -d ./keys myapp12

# Output: ./keys/myapp12xxxxx.onion/
#   ├── hostname        # Your .onion address
#   ├── hs_ed25519_public_key
#   └── hs_ed25519_secret_key
```

**Using mkp224o (GPU - much faster):**
```bash
# With CUDA support
./configure --enable-cuda
make

# Generate
./mkp224o -d ./keys myapp12
```

**Importing keys:**
1. Generate keys using mkp224o or similar tool
2. In admin panel, click "Import Keys"
3. Upload `hs_ed25519_secret_key` file (or zip containing both key files)
4. Confirm to replace current address
5. Tor restarts with imported keys

**Time estimates for longer prefixes:**

| Prefix Length | CPU Time | GPU Time |
|---------------|----------|----------|
| 7 chars | Days to weeks | Hours to days |
| 8 chars | Weeks to months | Days to weeks |
| 9+ chars | Months to years | Weeks to months |

**Security Notes:**
- .onion address shown only after admin authentication
- "Regenerate Address" requires confirmation modal (destructive - old address stops working)
- Address regeneration logged to audit log
- Imported keys should be generated on a trusted machine
- Delete source key files after successful import

### API Endpoints

**See PART 28 for full API route definitions under `/api/v1/admin/server/tor/`**

### Response Format

```json
{
  "enabled": true,
  "status": "connected",
  "onion_address": "abcd1234efgh5678ijkl9012mnop3456qrst7890uvwx.onion",
  "uptime": "2d 5h 30m"
}
```

## Behavior

| Scenario | Behavior |
|----------|----------|
| First run | Tor starts, generates .onion address, saves to config |
| Subsequent runs | Tor starts, uses existing .onion address |
| Disabled in config | Tor does not start, no .onion available |
| Regenerate address | Old keys deleted, new .onion generated, config updated |
| Network issues | Tor retries connection automatically |

## CLI

The `--status` command includes Tor status:

```
$ myapp --status

Server Status: Running
  Port: 8080
  Mode: production
  Uptime: 2d 5h 30m

Tor Hidden Service: Connected
  Address: abcd1234...wxyz.onion
```

# PART 33: AI ASSISTANT RULES (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

**These rules govern how AI assistants work on projects using this specification.**

## Before Starting Work

1. **Read AI.md completely** - understand all project-specific rules
2. **Check TODO.AI.md** - see pending tasks and their priority
3. **Verify understanding** - if anything is unclear, ASK before proceeding
4. **Never assume** - when in doubt, ask the user

## During Work

1. **Follow this spec exactly** - NON-NEGOTIABLE means NO exceptions
2. **Re-read relevant sections** before implementing each feature
3. **Update TODO.AI.md** as tasks are completed
4. **Test your changes** - don't commit untested code
5. **Keep changes focused** - one feature/fix per task

## After Work

1. **Update AI.md** if architecture or rules changed
2. **Update TODO.AI.md** with any new tasks discovered
3. **Verify compliance** - check against the FINAL CHECKPOINT

## Attribution

| Rule | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **NEVER** | Include AI attribution in code, comments, commits, or documentation |
| **NEVER** | "authored by Claude", "generated by AI", "Co-Authored-By: Claude" |
| **ALWAYS** | Code should appear as if written by a human developer |

## Tool Access

| Access | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| Full | All tools available |
| **EXCEPT** | `git push`, `git commit` - require explicit user request |
| Allowed | Stage files, create branches, check status, diff |
| Required | User must explicitly request commits and pushes |

## Prohibited Actions

| Action | Reason |
|--------|--------|
| `git push` without asking | May push unreviewed code |
| `git commit` without asking | User should review changes first |
| Deleting files without confirmation | Destructive action |
| Changing NON-NEGOTIABLE sections | Specification violation |
| Skipping validation | Security requirement |
| Hardcoding secrets | Security vulnerability |
| Using deprecated APIs | Maintainability issue |

## Code Style Rules (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

### Comment Placement

**Comments MUST always be placed ABOVE the code they describe. NEVER inline or below.**

| Placement | Allowed |
|-----------|---------|
| Above code | YES |
| Inline (same line) | NO |
| Below code | NO |

**Correct:**
```go
// Calculate the total price including tax
total := price * (1 + taxRate)

// User configuration options
type Config struct {
    // Server port number
    Port int
    // Enable debug mode
    Debug bool
}
```

**Incorrect:**
```go
total := price * (1 + taxRate) // Calculate total price - WRONG

total := price * (1 + taxRate)
// Calculate total price - WRONG (below)

type Config struct {
    Port int  // Server port - WRONG (inline)
    Debug bool // Debug mode - WRONG (inline)
}
```

**YAML comments - same rule:**
```yaml
# Enable multi-user mode
enabled: false

# Allow public registration
registration:
  enabled: false
```

### Code Quality Rules

| Rule | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **No magic numbers** | Use named constants |
| **No hardcoded strings** | Use constants or config |
| **Error handling** | Always handle errors, never ignore |
| **Input validation** | Validate ALL user input |
| **SQL injection** | Use parameterized queries only |
| **XSS prevention** | Escape all output in templates |
| **CSRF protection** | All forms must have CSRF tokens |

### File Organization

| Rule | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **One package per directory** | Standard Go convention |
| **Meaningful names** | `user.go` not `u.go` |
| **Group related code** | Keep related functions together |
| **Separate concerns** | Don't mix handlers with business logic |

## Handling Ambiguity

When the specification is unclear:

1. **Check if clarified elsewhere** - search the full spec
2. **Look for similar patterns** - how are similar features handled?
3. **Ask the user** - don't guess
4. **Document the decision** - add to AI.md for future reference

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

| Mistake | Correct Approach |
|---------|------------------|
| Implementing without reading spec | Read relevant PART first |
| Assuming default values | Check spec for defined defaults |
| Using .yaml instead of .yml | Always use `server.yml` |
| Inline comments | Comments above code only |
| Skipping admin panel | ALL settings need admin UI |
| Forgetting mobile-first | Start with mobile, expand to desktop |
| Using JavaScript alerts | Use proper notification system |
| Inline CSS | Use CSS files/classes only |
